This is my first post on my new fake blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/) on
[salted duck eggs.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg)

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.

```jsx
function test(param1, param2) {
  return true
}

array = [1, 2, 3]

console.log(1, 2, 3)

//highlight-start
const thisIsAVariable = "this is a variable"
//highlight-end

array.map((value, index) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{thisIsAVariable}</h2>
    </div>
  )
})

// comment
